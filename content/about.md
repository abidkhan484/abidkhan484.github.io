Hi there! Abid has been working as a professional software developer since 2018. Before that, he has started learning software engineering in 2012.

In his professional career, he has used a couple of technologies and tools for client support. Most of them are PHP-based backend development like Codeigniter, Drupal, Slim. He's also tasted Python-based Django, Flask, and some web scraping tools like Scrapy, Selenium web driver. He has also tried the Javascript-based front-end framework React.

Besides, he is able to design a database with a normalization process. For most of his career, he has worked with Mysql. But he is also familiar with Postgresql or MongoDB.

For the deployment process, he has played with the tools Ngnix, Apache, Docker, Virtualbox, Vagrant etc and also supporting the team as well.

Abid is able to support a project from requirement analysis to the deployment process.
